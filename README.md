# Riddle Me Game

In this project i decided to create another game. I choose to do a number game where you have to guess the number the computer is thinking off.
Each user is put into the leaderboard and their position depends on how well they do. Level 1 would be guess the number i am thinking of between 1
and 10. Level 2 would be between 1 and 20, and level 3 would be between 1 and 30. Each time a user guesses an incorrect number it will calculate how many
tries it has taken for the user to guess the correct answer. Every time a user submits a guess, the guess is stored underneath. There is only 3 levels
and the guesses from each level is added together to create an overall score which then is transfered to the leaderboard. First of all when you come
to the game you will be asked to enter a username. Once the user has submitted a username, it will go on to Level 1. 

### UX

First of all i decided on a colour scheme for the project. I decided to go for pinks and purples with white text. Once i had decided what the colour
scheme was i decided to make a rough plan on what the game would like. As the game was a guessing game i thought it would be sensible to use forms for
the user to submit answers as well as for the username. I decided to get the game to welcome each user by their username. I decided to create most of
the HTML and CSS first to get an overall look of the game. I wanted everything to be centered and resposive. Once i had got a rough plan of the game
i decided to start doing the Python for the project. Which i found rather difficult, i struggled to understand the indentation and the order of the
code. I would keep getting futher then going back as i kept breaking it. I have added a reset button so the user can restart the game throughout current
game. Ive also put a title at the top of the page stating what level you are on. I have decided to put the leaderboard underneath the game so you can
see what the highest scores are at all time. Every time the game is played the answers are different so you can't play over and over with the correct
answers. Every time you guess the correct answer you will move on to the next level. The leaderboard tells you the order of the users from first place
to last. The leaderboard also tells you how many tries it took for each level. I decided to use this font as it not too formal and suits the style of
the game. It also is clear and easy to read.

### Features

* I have used the hover feaure on the buttons
* You can reset the game throughout the current game
* I have used a leaderboad which can be seen throughout the game
* I have used the random number function which allows the correct answers to be different every time
* I have an input field where the user can type in a username, this makes me project more personal to the user
* I have an input field where the user can input their answers

### Technologies Used

* Cloud 9
* Git Hub
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* Json
* Jquery
* Python
* HTML

### Testing

* Does the game move from levels to the next level?
* Does the reset button reset the game?
* Does the game move on to Level 1 when a user has submitted a username?
* Does the users score go in the correct place on the leaderboard?
* Are the answers different every time?
* Does the button hover work?
* Does the game end when supposed too?
* Does the users answers store underneath?
* Does the game recongise when the correct number has been inputted?
* Does the game tell the user to guess higher or lower correctly?
